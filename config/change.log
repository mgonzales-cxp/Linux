# Updated bash.bashrc with the following aliases:
  #linux        - Changes directory to /usr/src/IT_Files/Linux.
  #it           - Changes directory to /usr/src/IT_Files.
  #run_nao      - Run the 5-minute cron script manually.
  #run_nightly  - Run the nighly cron script manually.
  #update       - sudo apt-get update
  #upgrade      - sudo apt-get upgrade
  #dist-upgrade - sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
  #reboot       - sudo reboot

  #Bash can be updated through nightly or manually via settings in config.

# As previously threatened, Coventry_Files has been removed from 
  the system info screen.

# Hosts files are now written to instead of copied with 
  Linux/xfce-uni/preferences/rewrite_hosts.sh $(hostname) since Kaspersky keeps
  wiping them. This has also been added to blacklist_update.sh

August 20, 2015
-----------------------
# Created Linux/cron/mem_youtube.sh to allow Memphis to access YouTube by
  editing the host file. Also can use Linux/cron/mem_youtube_exts.txt
  to target certain extensions.

# Created Linux/xfce-uni/preferences/rewrite_hosts.sh to write directly to
  /etc/hosts as Kaspersky keeps destroying our hosts seed. It can be ran
  via cron continuously and it's easy to add new entries.

# When re-profiling to a different client, each client script will remove 
  the other client's folders in /usr/src/.

August 18, 2015
-------------------------
# SAT is now running the stagger script locally at 11PM, then 
  calling nightly on the file server.

# All called functions are now passed through CheckDate() for 
  scheduling purposes.

# Re-compiled update_tech_password.sh.x to be able to run on any 
  computer with  the same OS.

# Added change to root password in update_tech_password.sh.x.

# Fixed issue with config reading the new password.

August 17, 2015
-------------------------
# Created a compiled bash script called update_tech_password.sh.x in the 
  Linux/cron folder. This will update the password on the local tech 
  account to the new tech password.

# Added script variable $update_tech_password in nightly_functions.sh

# Added call to $update_tech_password in Nightly().

# Created a tbt.sh file on the file server (hal2).  Floor techs can now use a 
  local profile called aetna-training on the production machines and run this
  script for TBT training.

# Fixed an issue where the Aetna profile script wasn't creating the 
  DRx Scraper flag (hal2).
	# Code added to line 118 in aet.sh:
		touch /var/log/drx_scraper.flag

August 5, 2015
---------------------
# Adjusted stagger times for nightly.sh
# Rebuilt nightly.sh which now consists of three scripts in 
  /usr/src/IT_Files/Linux/cron:
    # stagger_nightly.sh
    # nightly_functions.sh
    # nightly.sh

    # New functions, changes and scripts calls should be added to 
      nighty_functions.sh then
    # called in nightly.sh!
# Added "Cron duration" field in the System Info page.

August 4, 2015
---------------------

# Nightly cron is now staggered so that every workstation will 
  run the cron at a different time.
# Improved and fixed issue with the way config.sh made IT_Files 
  mount when copied and ran locally.

July 17, 2015
-------------

# Improved functionality of training_pictures.sh to include:
      # Making a local backup of the PNG.
      # Rename files without extensions in Pictures folder to .png
      # Rename files with .PNG to .PNG in Pictures folder.
      # Move .png files to screenshots folder on file server.

# Added the 107 octet to the sites array in training_pictures.sh for the tower.
  Anything on 107 wasn't getting the new folders and the PNG moves/copies.

# Created a new header script that only includes colors, paths, hostname and
  logname

# Added Aetna SS extensions 5430 - 5443 to exts2.txt for launcher_slc.sh

# Updated blacklist_update.sh to prepend a 'C' or a 'T' depending on if they're
  production(C) or training(T). Otherwise, it will give a warning and ask if 
  it's a production or training machine. If it is, it will write the appropriate
  flags and update the hostname with the appropriate leading character.
  Otherwise, it updates without a character prepended.
 	
  The script now also checks to see if the computer name is tech or Ctech and 
  state whether it may be a default name and needs to be updated at least once.
  If it's not tech or Ctech, it states that the hostname may have already been
  updated and asks if the user would like to update.

July 16, 2015
-------------

# Created script training_pictures.sh to automatically copy PNGs from
  the pictures folder for training. These are moved into:
  /usr/src/IT_Files/Linux/screenshots/[site_specific_folder]

  NOC - Please email these as requested and move them into the 'emailed'
  folder when they've been sent to a trainer.

July 8, 2015
------------

# Updated file structure.

# Added array for various different exit commands in main.sh

July 7, 2015
------------

# Added this here page!

# Config no longer requires a password if root. Yay!
